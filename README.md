# Calculate Date to Return
Calculate the date to return an item to a store.

Every store has different number of days to return an item.

This is not a full app with a UI. This is just a functionality. The code can be copied and pasted into JSBin.com with MomentJS added as a library to run it.

If MomentJS can't be used, add DayJS CDN
`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dayjs@1/dayjs.min.js"></script>`
